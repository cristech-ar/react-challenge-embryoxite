## Overview
This project is a React application written in TypeScript, designed to manage and display a tree structure with data stored in localStorage. The app features a clean and modern UI inspired by Apple's typography and design standards. Users can:

- View the tree in a read-only mode.
- Add and delete nodes in an editable mode.
- Expand and collapse individual nodes or the entire tree.
- Enjoy real-time notifications and smooth animations.

The app leverages Material UI (MUI) components for a polished user experience and integrates Vite for blazing-fast development and optimized production builds.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

### Tree Component
- **Dynamic Properties**:
  - `title`: Displays the root node name.
  - `value`: Accepts a JSON structure representing the tree.
  - `onChange`: Callback triggered with the updated JSON on node addition or deletion.
  - `editable`: Toggles between edit and view modes.

- **Editable Mode**:
  - Add a child node with a validated text input form.
  - Delete a node while preserving tree integrity.

- **View Mode**:
  - Display a structured tree using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.
  - Collapse or expand nodes using intuitive icon buttons.

- **Global Controls**:
  - Collapse/Expand All functionality for efficient navigation.

### Notifications
- Real-time feedback with Snackbar for node additions and deletions.

### Persistent Data
- Automatically saves the tree structure in `localStorage` as JSON.

### Responsive UI
- Styled using MUI for a seamless, visually appealing interface.

### Storybook Integration
- Preview the `Tree` component in isolation using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### Routing with React Router
- Two pages:
  - **Home**: A static landing page.
  - **Tree Page**: Displays the interactive tree component.
